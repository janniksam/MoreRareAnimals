## Features

There are two commands that you can use:

- **moreeanimals**: Use ***moreanimals 4*** to let 4 times the amount of domestic animals spawn on each large island. The rate must be between 1 - 50.
- **morerareanimals**: Use ***morerareanimals 20 50 30*** to increase the chances for rare skin 1 to 50% and rare skin 2 to 30%. All parameters must be positve and sum up to 100% in total.
- **moreanimalscales**: Use ***moreanimalscales 0.5 2.5*** to spawn animals, that scale between 50% and 250% of its normal size. Default scaling ranges are between 0.8 to 1.2.
